# Wordle Solver

reboot of my [old wordle solver](github.com/rgodha24/wordle), written in rust this time

current average solve is 3.838876889848812 guesses, which can probably be improved by using the actualy NYT words list, not the old one from before NYT bought wordle.

to run it, [install rust](https://rustup.rs), then run cargo run --release in the root
